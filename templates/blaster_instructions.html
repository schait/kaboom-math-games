                <li>Command Ships have equations on them that you need to solve.
                <ul>
                    <li>When facing Command Ships, you may hide behind the wall on the bottom left for as long as you want
                        while you solve the equation.</li>
                    <li>Once you solve the equation, enter your answer to select your ammo. You cannot shoot until you select
                        ammo.</li>
                    <li>If you hit a Command Ship with the wrong ammo, it will shoot 3 fireballs at you which cannot be blocked
                        by your shield. So be careful!</li>
